This repository consists of various basic statistics and machine learning methods I wrote in Scala for my Big data and machine learning course. It includes the following categories 
* It includes basic methods like variance, covariance, mean etc for statistic methods like Binomial distribution, multinomial and bernouli.
* It includes machine learning categories like basic 1d classification, Naive Beyes classifier, Hierarchical clustering and K-means clustering. 
* It includes basic Matrix operations, including matrix addition, subtraction, elementwise matrix multiplication, dot product and recursive matrix determinant calculation.

The Scala code is designed in a Object-oriented way so one can pull the data in to the command and create a object, say 
```Scala
var m = new Matirx(Seq[Seq[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], Seq[1.0, 1.0, 1.0]])
```
and call correspoinding functions.
